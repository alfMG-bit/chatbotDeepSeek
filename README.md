A chatbot using DeepSeek API, its porpouse is to analyze documents based on a rubric and give feedback.

You must add the following to use this project:

- Generate an API KEY, I did it from openroute and paste it on app.py
- Create a SECRET KEY and put it on app.py
- Download wkhtmltopdf and install it, paste the route on app.py
- If you want to create an activity as "docente" you must edit the hierarchy manually, I used DB Browser for SQLite.

  You must run first db.py in order to create all database tables.
